# Final Project part 1 

## Outline 

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, mental health challenges are more prevalent than ever, with stress, anxiety, and depression impacting millions globally. While traditional approaches to mental health management often focus on therapy or medication, the transformative power of exercise and sports is frequently overlooked. This project aims to highlight the profound relationship between physical activity and mental well-being, backed by data and visual storytelling.

Through this project, I aim to show:

1) How mental health has worsened in sedentary populations over time.
2) The specific benefits of exercise and sports on reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.
3) Practical, evidence-based recommendations for integrating movement into daily life.

What the readers will gain: 

1) Awareness: Understand the undeniable link between physical activity and mental health improvement.
2) Actionable Insights: Learn how small, consistent changes in activity levels can lead to significant mental health benefits.
3) Tools for Change: Access recommendations and resources for incorporating exercise into daily routines.
4) Empowerment: Discover achievable ways to enhance mental health and well-being through movement.
