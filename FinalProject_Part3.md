# Changes made since part 2 

Between Part 2 and the final submission, significant changes were implemented to enhance the narrative flow, visual appeal, and overall engagement of the project. One improvement was the restructuring of the introduction to make sure readers had context and understanding of the story. I added a paragraph introducing my topic which I did not have in part 2. This paragraph gave viewers much needed context before I dived deeper into my story. Another simple but imperative change I made was highlighting the required part of my personal data, this made the users focus on what I wanted them to and what seemed difficult to interpet in part 2 ( Professor gave me this feedback) was now much more understandable and interpretable. 

Based on user feedback, another change I made was adding a visual for average screen time for GenZ , this was a significant change as it was a very powerful statistic that was earlier just a line of text and not very impactful. When I represented the statistic with a clock to try and showcase the amount of time, It was very impactful and the readers were able to visualize how significant that amount of time truly is. Another change I made was in my call to action - initially what I had was just a very generic call to action to exercise but eventually I made it more direct added links and sources to give the audience a headstart 

# Target Audience 

The project is tailored for young adults and college students, who often struggle to balance academics, personal responsibilities, and maintaining their physical and mental well-being. This audience is particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of sedentary behavior due to excessive screen time, irregular sleep patterns, and the high pressures of academic life. By focusing on relatable scenarios and practical advice, the project aims to resonate deeply with this demographic.

The content is designed to not only inform but also inspire action among the audience by providing clear, actionable steps to integrate movement into their daily lives. The tone is empathetic and motivational, acknowledging the challenges faced by students while emphasizing the benefits of small, consistent efforts to improve mental health through physical activity. Through a combination of data, storytelling, and user-centric design, the project seeks to empower young adults to take meaningful steps toward a healthier lifestyle.

# Final Design Decisions 

As mentioned above in the changes made since part 2, one of the key design decisions was adding a clear introduction to give readers context before diving into the data. This made the story easier to follow and more engaging. Another change was replacing generic statistics with visuals, like a clock representation for average screen time. This approach made the data more impactful and relatable.

The call to action was also refined. Initially, it was broad, but I adjusted it to focus on specific, achievable steps. This made it more actionable for the audience. These changes were guided by user feedback and aimed at improving clarity and relevance.

 # Final Thoughts 

Overall, this project was a rewarding experience. It helped me better understand how to use data to tell a compelling story and connect with the audience. I wish I had more time to explore additional visuals or examples to strengthen the narrative further. My favorite but most challenging part of the project was finding data and creating some infrographics , I new this topic would resonate with my classmates and I felt that it did eventually. I hope I was able to convince them to start exercising frequently. Some of the data even startled me and especially the screen time one which made me put my phone away. One thing I did was not use tableau in this final presentation - I used other ways like infographics , statistics to highlight my data. I wanted to do something different as tableau had already been used a fair bit in the course
