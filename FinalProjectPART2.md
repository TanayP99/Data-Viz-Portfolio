## User research protocol

### Target audience 

Young adults and college students, particularly those who:

1) Struggle with balancing academics and mental wellbeing
   
2) Struggle to make time for physical activity and exercise
   
3) Are dealing with anxiety, stress and are struggling to deal with the pressure

### Purpose 

The goal of this user research is to evaluate how effectively my storyboards and visualizations communicate the relationship between physical activity and mental health to young adults and college students. I aim to gather feedback on the narrative flow, clarity of visuals, and relevance of the message to ensure the story resonates with my target audience. Specifically, I want to learn:

1) Whether the visuals are clear, engaging, and easy to understand.
2) If the narrative flow is logical and relatable.
3) How motivating and actionable the call-to-action feels to the audience.
   
This feedback will help me refine my story in the next phase by improving unclear elements, adjusting visuals, and enhancing the overall impact.

### Interview script 

For my interviews, I am targeting young adults and college students who represent my primary audience. These interviewees will provide valuable insights into their experiences with stress, anxiety, and time management, as well as their current habits regarding exercise and physical activity. By understanding their challenges, motivations, and preferences, I can refine my storyboards and visualizations to better resonate with their needs and create actionable, relatable content that encourages positive lifestyle changes.

Questions:- 

Initially I set some context and gather some information related to my story and then proceed to show my storyboard and wireframes , sketches and ask questions regarding the same 

1) Can you tell me a little about your daily routine, especially how you manage your time between academics, work, and personal life?
2) How often do you feel stressed or anxious during a typical week? What do you think are the main causes?
3) Do you currently engage in any physical activity or exercise? If yes, how often? If no, what prevents you from doing so?

4) When you look at this storyboard, does the overall story make sense to you? Does it feel easy to follow?
5) Are there any parts of the story you found confusing or did not understand
6) Can you relate to the story being told?

7) Do the visualizations fit into the storyline and communicate the message, are they clear to understand
8) Is there anything you would change ?
9) Is the Call to Action motivating and encouraging for you?
10) Is there any additional information you wish was included?


## User Research Findings 

I conducted three interviews with the following people
1) 25 year old student
2) 19 year old student
3) 21 year old in first job

Below is a detailed documentation of my findings and learnings from the interviews I conducted 

Some of my learnings from my interviews are - 
Learnings from the Interviews


Narrative and Storyline:
Interviewees found the story easy to follow and appreciated its logical flow. However, one person suggested making the introduction more attention-grabbing to immediately highlight the problem - she suggested a better title instead of current one. Adding a statistic or a brief anecdote at the start could make the introduction more impactful and engaging.

Relatability:
The interviewees felt the challenges presented, such as managing stress, balancing academics, and struggling with physical activity, were highly relatable. They suggested adding examples of how these issues affect daily life, such as feeling tired or having difficulty focusing, to make the narrative even more engaging and realistic.

Visual Effectiveness:
The visuals were clear and engaging, supporting the narrative effectively. However, a few participants recommended using brighter or contrasting colors for charts to improve readability. Adding annotations or short captions to explain the key takeaway of each chart was also suggested to enhance clarity. The pie chart needs to have annotations to show how many hours for each activity 

Call-to-Action:
The interviewees found the call-to-action motivating but two of them wanted more actionable examples such as what exercises they can do at home, how they can progress from beginner to advanced in the gym etc


How I plan to incorporate the feedback - To implement the feedback from the interviews in the next part, I plan to refine the introduction by incorporating a more attention-grabbing title and opening with a relevant statistic or brief anecdote to immediately engage the audience. I will make the visuals more impactful by using brighter colors, adding annotations, and including captions to highlight key takeaways clearly. For example, the pie chart will be updated with annotations to clarify the distribution of activities. Additionally, I will enhance the call-to-action by providing actionable examples, such as specific exercises students can do at home and tips for progressing in fitness routines. These changes aim to make the narrative more engaging, relatable, and actionable for the target audience
